            <h2>Rocadily Restaurant Project</h2>
            <p>  In this project, we created a restaurant website with different features in a team of 5 members using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery library. We created the restaurant website for a  traditionally themed 50’s dinner restaurant that strives to give its customers the nostalgic feeling of being in a real dinner from the era. We kept the same header and footer throughout the restaurant website by using the global pages. We used  javaScript for our features and developed this project. We did the features of home page, about us, contact us, gift cards, locations, menus, events booking, careers, site map, specials and contest. We designed the website in a way easy to understand by people.<p>

                        <p class="contentBox"> I did the features of the gift card page and careers page for this project. I was the team member who created the mockup for the project. We created the global pages that my team-leader shared with all team-members. We did this project step by step. Firstly, we created the template and the global css file. We also completed the wireframes and mockups before creating this project. The home page was created in a way that controlled the whole website for the unique header and footer. The unique header and footer was one of the requirements of this project.</p>

            <h2>Paradise Resort Project</h2>
            <p> In this project, we created a resort website with different features both with admin and public functionality. The public interface is not requiring any type of login and anyone can use the website for the public pages and get whatever they want to get from the website. People can read the  blogs, book rooms in the resort, book the resort for events, contact the resort admins, fill the forms for jobs in the resort, look for activities in the resort, can give feedback and can also apply for help from the resort. Tha admin has to login first with his login credentials before using the resort website then he/she  can do his/her job of managing the resort website. The admin has full control on all the website features and he can manage all the public information for the resort website related to the features that i explained above for the public view. The admin can use full CRUD for any of the features of the website.<p>

                        <p class="contentBox"> I did the features of room booking and eventbooking. I was the team member who created the Home page for the website with both public and admin interface. I created the global pages that I shared with my team-members. We did this project step by step. Firstly, we created the interfaces then started creating the databases. After that, we completed the CRUD functionalities. I created the login functionality that used cookies and sessions for the admin interface. I was the designer for this project as I created the home page also that in a way controlled the whole website for the unique header and footer.<p>

            <h2>Final API Project</h2>
            <p>In this project, I was supposed to create a website using 3 different API's to show  creativity and really see what can be done with APIs. I was supposed to make a useful website and use the APIs to supplement my code for better functionality. I created a search website using three different API’s. Only the public interface was coded for this website and is not requiring any type of sign-in before using the website. I created a search website by using Pexels API for image search, Weather API for weather search and Google Maps API to tell the location of the search cafe. The users can use the search website for multiple purposes like searching images and searching weather. I created a unique design for the website by keeping header and footer the same throughout the website. For these three different API integrations, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I used bootstrap for designing these pages.<p>

            <h2>MY EXPERIENCE OF THE FIRST SEMESTER OF THE WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE</h2>
            <p>I am writing about my feelings after completing the first semester of the Web Development course of Humber College. I am from India. I joined this course because my parents wanted me to do this course. My father had a dream of becoming a web developer but he was not able to fulfil his dream. For my parents, I joined this course after doing a Bachelor of science. The financial condition of my family is not good. In some way, they managed to pay my fees. After that, it was in my hands to fulfil their dream. During my first week of classes I was getting worried because this was totally a new stream for me. I had not even used a computer before doing this course. In India, I have done only theoretical study. I was getting embarrassed but the teachers supported me throughout this four month first semester journey and even now they are supporting me a lot. My good learning abilities and hard-working nature helped me to do well in this course. I have completed many projects and assignments related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and MySQL on my own. During this time, I realised the impact of the technology on our lives. I studied the subject Database Design and Development during this semester which made me clear how the complex data is managed nowadays by using technology instead of writing down everything by hand. I started imagining things like how the company Give and Go is keeping record of the thousands of the workers where I also work by using the database concepts. I also learned about using many new tools like Adobe Photoshop and Visual Studio. I am still trying to understand as much as I can about the new web development trends from my colleagues, teachers and on my own by using the online resources like Google search so as to become an efficient web developer by the end of this course. I believe in hard work and by doing this 4-month hard work I have now full confidence that I can become a web developer. When I started this course, it was not clear to me in which direction this course will take me whether I will become a web developer or I will ruin my one year doing this course. But now my parents are happy to see my passion to become a web developer and they are feeling proud of me. So, nothing is impossible in this world and every person can do anything that they want and we should always do what our heart says is correct. My experience of this course is an awesome part of my life.<p>

            <h2>HOW WEB DEVELOPEMENT RELATES TO US?</h2>
            <p>As a web developer, I have learned many programming languages and technologies. Now, I clearly understand how the technology is affecting our lives. In this post, I will be writing about different instances where I feel the technology is being used nowadays. Firstly about grocery stores where people can buy things like milk, vegetables and fruits. When people make payments someone really notices the database that is being used to store the codes of the different things in order to fulfill the payments. That is really interesting how the price is being calculated by just scanning the code. Another interesting example that I have is of the company Give and Go where i work. I was surprised by seeing how all the workers' personal data, their shift hours and their payment record is maintained by the company on the computer. After studying database design and development, it was no longer a surprise for me. Furthermore, the websites which we visit daily are also created by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other languages. We never try to explore these things. After I started studying Web Development, I started exploring these things and I became habitual of viewing source code of the websites so as to look at what logic is being used to create that site. These things exist but people can never understand until they are taught about this or proper information is provided to them. Moreover, my family members even don’t know about this. But, I try to tell them as much as I can about the web technology that is nowadays an essential part of our lives. My cousin Charanpreet Kaur who works in Subway was surprised and she told me that in her Subway even records of each bread are kept and their hours are also recorded by using the computer. She also told me that a net earning graph is also plotted after one week by the computer on its own. I then told her about the web programming that is doing all this stuff and making our lives more easier and organised. Therefore, I am very glad that I am aware about all these things and I will also be trying to encourage other people to know about web technology.<p>
